# Flow Navigation
## Motivation
React Navigation and similar packages work fine for navigation between 'scenes' and tabs and so forth.
However I have often lacked an inner navgation. Load in a list of components and navigate between them
smoothly in an inner flow.

NOTE! This is a work in progress.

## Integration

## Routes

```
const routes = [{
  title: 'firstComponent'
  component: jsx component
  startPosition: -1, 0, 1
}]
```
